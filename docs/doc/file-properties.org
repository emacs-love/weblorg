#+TITLE: File Properties

* Intro

  When an Org-Mode file is parsed by weblorg, all the file level
  properties are collected and made available to templates as
  properties to a ~post~ object.  Let's look at an example of an
  Org-Mode file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC org-mode
  #+TITLE: A quick reminder
  #+SLUG: reminder
  #+DRAFT: t
  #+DATE: <2021-01-31 Sun>

  This is an exciting post reminding everyone that Emacs is not only
  an editor, but a *powerful* and *friendly* tool for the creatives out
  there :)
  #+END_SRC

  Let's now think of how a template to render the above file could
  look like:

  #+BEGIN_SRC jinja2
  <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
  <div class="date">{{ post.date | strftime("%m-%d-%Y") }}</div>
  <div class="content">
    {{ post.html | safe }}
  </div>
  #+END_SRC

  Values for attributes ~title~ and ~date~ come straight from the file
  properties.  Notice that ~date~ isn't a string though.  It is a time
  tuple that can be formatted with the template filter ~strftime~.

  The ~html~ attribute is the exception, not really coming from file
  properties, but rather storing the content of the Org-Mode file
  rendered by ~ox-html~.

  All file properties used to control the Org-Mode rendering via
  ~ox-html~ are untouched, so you can still use things like
  ~#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil~ for example.

* title

  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug][slugified]] version of the property ~title~ is used as the name of
  the output file (with the extension ~.html~ concatenated to it).  As
  you'll see next, the ~slug~ property can override the output file
  name.

* date

  The ~date~ field is parsed and transformed in a time tuple that can
  be formatted with the help of the [[url_for:api,anchor=symbol-weblorg-filters-strftime][strftime]] template filter.  This
  field is also used by [[url_for:api,anchor=symbol-weblorg-input-aggregate-all][weblorg-input-aggregate-all]],
  [[url_for:api,anchor=symbol-weblorg-input-aggregate-all-desc][weblorg-input-aggregate-all-desc]],
  [[url_for:api,anchor=symbol-weblorg-input-aggregate-by-category][weblorg-input-aggregate-by-category]] and
  [[url_for:api,anchor=symbol-weblorg-input-aggregate-by-category-desc][weblorg-input-aggregate-by-category-desc]] to sort the posts.

* slug

  The ~slug~ property takes precedence over the title when generating
  an output file name.  The HTML file generated from our example
  Org-Mode above, would be named ~reminder.html~ the way it is or
  ~a-quick-reminder.html~ if we removed the ~slug~ file property.

  Notice: If an Org-Mode file does not have either the ~slug~ or the
  ~title~ file property, weblorg uses the name of the Org-Mode file itself
  as the output file name, replacing the ~.org~ extension by ~.html~.

* draft

  If a given Org-Mode file isn't ready to be published on your
  website, mark it with ~#+DRAFT: t~ and weblorg will skip rendering
  it.

  This feature works in tandem with the ~:input-filter~ option of
  [[url_for:api,anchor=symbol-weblorg-route][weblorg-route]].  By default, it will be set to use
  [[url_for:api,anchor=weblorg-input-filter-drafts][weblorg-input-filter-drafts]].  If you want to disable filtering
  drafts, set ~:input-filter~ to ~nil~ on your route.

* filetags

  To organize posts in categories, use the ~filetags~ property.  One
  single post can belong to more than one category. For example, to
  say that a post belongs to both ~blogging~ and ~emacs~ categories,
  you can use: ~#+FILETAGS: :blogging:emacs:~
